## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists
ATS and recruiter software often strip away formatting, bullets, and design elements â€” leaving a plain-text version of your resume that can look very different from the PDF you submit. **Resume Parser** reveals that hidden view so you can improve based on facts, not guesswork. Runs entirely **offline** â€” your data never leaves your machine.


This is a project by **Digital Resume Solutions LLC**, created with a privacy-first approach. Everything runs locally on your machine â€” your data never leaves your computer.


## ðŸš€ Features
- **ATS text view** â€“ See the raw text an ATS extracts.  
- **Skills check** â€“ Detect missing job-specific keywords & tech skills.  
- **Recruiter preview** â€“ View a clean, parsed version of your resume.  
- **Formatting audit** â€“ Spot lost layout, bullets, or special chars.  
- **Privacy-first** â€“ 100% local processing.


## ðŸ›  Skills Checker

Scan your resume for **general** or **role-specific** skills from a curated dataset.  
See whatâ€™s recognized â€” and whatâ€™s missing.
