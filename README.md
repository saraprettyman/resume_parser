## Overview
Resume Parser is an open-source resume analysis tool built by **Digital Resume Solutions LLC**.  
It’s designed to show how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) read your resume, alongside a **recruiter’s-eye view** — helping you make clear, impactful improvements.

Unlike “ATS-beating” gimmick tools, Resume Parser focuses on:
- **Transparency** — You see the raw parsed text.
- **Constructive feedback** — No meaningless “percent match” scores.
- **Privacy-first** — Works locally, no data sent to third parties.
- **Education** — Learn what ATS really do (and don’t do).

## Features
- **ATS Text Parse** — See exactly how your resume text appears to parsing software.

- **Formatting Loss Checker** — Spot what gets lost when ATS reads PDFs.
- **Offline-first** — Run it locally for complete privacy.
